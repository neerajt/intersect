# intersect

bash script to compare two lists, originally
written to compare SNP lists in genotyping data.

This script compares two lists and can be called from the terminal:

`$bash intersect.sh [-1=<colnum>] [-2=<colnum>] [-v] list1 list2`

if you want to compare only one
 column from a file, use the . `-1/-file1col` and/or the
 `-2/-file2col` arguments
